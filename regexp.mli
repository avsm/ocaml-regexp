(**This module can be safely open for it only contains a module [Re].
   It provides regular expressions (AKA regexp, re) in pure OCaml. Although
   more efficient implementations exist, this one is the more portable: all of
   mirage backends can use it. It is based on Claude MarchÃ©'s library. More

module Re : sig

(** This module provides functions for creating and using Regular Expression.

   It is in pure OCaml (unlike Pcre_Ocaml) and thus more portable. It is
   reentrant (unlike Str) but not thread-safe in case of preemptive schedulling.
